  <h1>stretch silo</h1>
  <p>
    A stretch cursor targeting system for a 360 missile defense game.
  </p>
  <p>
    Six cities are being attacked by an endless hail of ballistic missiles, some of which split like multiple
    independently
    targetable reentry vehicles. New aggressors are introduced in later stages: bomber planes who fly overhead,
    kamikazes
    that can evade a less-than-perfectly targeted missile and aliens that loop around the island launching missiles of
    their
    own. As a regional commander of three anti-missile batteries, you must utilize your stretch-cursor and time-shift
    drive
    to counter the onslaught and defend your cities from being destroyed.
