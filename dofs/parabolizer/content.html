  Late 2020 I imagined that I wanted to control a spatial parabola with my 2 hands. At first I struggled trying to make a parabola because I was thinking with only 2 points. About a year later with the creation of the back handed stretch cursor I realized I could utilize a third point by combining the original stretch cursor with this new one.
