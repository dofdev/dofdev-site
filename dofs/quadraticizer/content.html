  Late 2020 I imagined that I wanted to control a spatial parabola with my 2 hands. At first I struggled trying to make a parabola because I was thinking with only 2 points. Half a year later I considered utilizing a mid plane perpendicular to the straight line between 2 points, and then using the rotation of a hand to cast a ray onto that plane you can get a spataially controllable parabola. Taking it to the next level, it's possible to use the rotation of the second hand to control a spatial cursor whose depth is decided by the parabola. Then applying a back handed stretch cursor you can control 2 spatial cursors from 1 anchor hand meaning you have 3 spatial cursors under your control that you could then use to control a spatial quadratic bezier curve
